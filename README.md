## 📌 Recommendations by Data Analysis

1. **Retention Focus on Female Employees**
   - Attrition is higher among female employees. Conduct targeted surveys or exit interviews to understand and address their concerns.

2. **Engagement for 26–35 Age Group**
   - This group represents the largest portion of the workforce. Investing in their development, mentorship, and career growth will yield long-term benefits.

3. **Encourage Departmental Diversity**
   - Sales and HR departments show noticeable gender gaps. Initiatives for gender balance can enhance team performance and inclusivity.

4. **Leverage Top Education Fields**
   - Leverage the strong base in **Life Sciences** and **Medical** through specialized training or leadership grooming.

5. **Support Business Travelers**
   - Employees who travel frequently might face higher burnout. Consider offering flexible work hours or travel support programs.

6. **Low Attrition Does Not Equal Satisfaction**
   - Although attrition is balanced in raw numbers, analyzing **job satisfaction levels** deeper can reveal underlying dissatisfaction not yet turned into attrition.
